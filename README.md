# part1-Introduction-to-React

This section is part of the [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/#course-contents) course. In this first approach to the React library, the application was created using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for a faster and more modern development setup (migrated from Create React App).

Topics covered in this part include JavaScript fundamentals, component state, event handlers, and debugging.

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#mac-stable) (optional; you can also use `npm`)

## Start the application

In this part, you will find three directories, each of them is a React project. For example:

```bash
# Navigate to the directory of the desired project, e.g., courseinfo
$ cd courseinfo

# Install dependencies
$ yarn install
# or
$ npm install

# Start the application
$ yarn dev
# or
$ npm run dev
```
